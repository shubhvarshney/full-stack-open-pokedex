    The application is coded in Java. For linting, checkstyle is a popular and useful tool that will ensure that developer code aligns with Java coding standards. For testing, Selenium can be used to handle web browser action automation, and JUnit can be used for the actual unit testing of the Java application. FOr building, a tool such as Apache's Maven can be used, in which compilation, testing and packaging can be combined. 

    There are many alternatives to Jenkins and Github Actions. There's GitLab CI, JetBrains TeamCity, and AWS CodePipline. These are a lot more integrated with DevOps and recognized for their CI/CD capabilities so are good choices too.

    This setup would be better in a cloud environment witht he information we currently have because it seems like a small to medium project (with only a team of six.) This will also be a cheaper option and provide easier configuration. However, we would need more information. If this software needs special requirements for the tests, such as a graphics card, because it is for example a large video game, and the team needs more resources, self-hosting might become a better option. So, we'd need to know exactly what this project is and what kinds of tools we'd need for testing.
